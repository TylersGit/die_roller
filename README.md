# Die Roller
I started writing this program to let myself easily roll massive amounts of dice easily, and to generate D&D stat arrays without all the hassle it involves. 

## Features:
- Roll any die, any number of times.
- Calculate the average of multiple iterations of a roll set.
- Roll stat arrays.


## Things to do: 
- Make the main die_roller.py code neater
- Add exception handling.
- Add the ability to save rolls to a separate file.
